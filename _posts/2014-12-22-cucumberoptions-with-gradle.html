So, to make Gradle work like the maven:

{% highlight bash %}mvn test -Dcucumber.options="..."{% endhighlight %}

you have to do some extra magic. When Gradle forks a new process dedicated for tests it doesn't automatically forward the original system properties. In order to achieve this, the following needs to be added:

{% highlight groovy %}
test {systemProperties = System.properties}
{% endhighlight %}

It took me a couple hours to figure it out, so here ya go! If you have multiple test tasks, you can also do it in one stab:

{% highlight groovy %}tasks.withType(Test) {systemProperties = System.properties}{% endhighlight %}

For a full working example check out my <a href="https://github.com/danielsiwiec/cucumber-java-skeleton">fork</a> of cucumber-java-skeleton, adding gradle support.
